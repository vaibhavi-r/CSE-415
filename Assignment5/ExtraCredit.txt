-----------------------
Staying true to the author's style of speaking in rhymes, the conversational agent speaks in rhyming sentences.

In each turn, Madeline chooses to either respond based on the opponent remark, or the game state alternately while staying true to character.

iii)The initial state of the board

E.g. When there are no more blank spaces- Madeline acknowledges the end.
E.g. When NO move is made (unexpected during game), Madeline admits she is confused also.
E.g. When the score is improved by a lot - she shows happiness
E.g. When the current score is worsened - she shows determination to improve

C) Responds to opponent remarks
---------------------------------
Madeline looks for trigger words in the opponent remarks and responds with different emotions in a rhyming fashion.
E.g. "Win" "Lose" "Play"  and 10 more words invoke a different response from Madeline
