'''priorityq.py
A module that provides a custom priority queue implementation
for use in A* and similar algorithms.

Version of Oct. 18, 2017, 3:00 PM,  which contains
an adjustment to handle duplicate priority values
together with elements that don't implement
the __lt__ method.

Ties are broken by adding a small random adjustment value
to the new priority value.  These adjustments are less than
0.00001.

The Oct. 18 fixes the double-deletion error found
in the Oct. 17 version.
